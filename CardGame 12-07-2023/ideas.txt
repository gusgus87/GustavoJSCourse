game.js will include a deck object and a game obj. 
A deck is a collection 4* sets of 13* card objects. 	
	Each set is a suit that consists of 13* comparable hexidecimal ranked denominations.
		Suits will have comparable but unranked values. 
	The collection will be an array of card objects. 
	The deck obj will have 2 methods: 
		Shuffle
			Randomly mixes collection of cards differently each time
		Deal
			Assigns cards to players and removes from dealable cards 
The game obj structures the game by using methods such as:
	compare
		compares suits unranked unless there is a trump card
		compares denom by rank using hexidec num system
	play
		takes card from a p1 & p2 to compare and removes card from players' hands
		returns winner.
	win
		return the winner after all rounds.
	end
		Ends the game when a player has 0 cards in their hand. 
	declareWinner
		display the winner
