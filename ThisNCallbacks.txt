This and Callback Functions 

My understanding,

    Callback Functions:
        These are functions that are more versitile. You can now have a stronger function that can
        execute similar functions that do completely different things. Also it can be used to 
        catch bad values before being passed to a callback function. Capable of drastically cleaning up 
        code if put to use properly. 

    This keyword:
        Can be tricky. Will go to the nearest object. Binding can be useful to get 'this'
        where you want it to be. A bit unclear why using this would be so much better than 
        specifying the object you want. I have a better understanding of this but would like
        more understanding of why and when to use it.
